## Features

- *Vehicle Tracking*: Utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time vehicle object tracking.
- *Vehicle Counting*: Counts the number of vehicles in specified regions to determine traffic density.
- *Traffic Signal Management*: Adjusts signal timings based on vehicle count to optimize traffic flow.
- *Signal Violation Detection*: Detects vehicles attempting to cross a red signal, enhancing safety.
